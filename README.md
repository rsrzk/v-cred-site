# V-Cred's first public website

This website was created for V-Cred (early stage software startup) back when we urgently needed a website. I was learning Next.js at the time (as I heard my teammate talk about it) so decided to make our first website following some tutorials and using a template for its design. We have since modified the website many times and the latest version of the company website can likely be found here (https://www.rosarylabs.ai/). Company name has changed to Rosary Labs after rebranding.

This was previously hosted on vercel using our https://v-cred.com domain (now deprecated). It can now still be found on https://v-cred-site.vercel.app/ . It was created using next.js and typescript.

Using free Next.js startup website template (https://nextjstemplates.com/templates/saas-starter-startup)
